# system-security-project

This project was developed for the System Security class at ESIEE Paris by the students Bruno Castro and Victor SÃ¼ndermann.

The /docs folder contains the PDFs used as reference during the development, and the /scripts folder has all the scripts developed (one for each rule).

To run the codes on a UBUNTU bash, it's necessary to build each file before running it. In order to do that, run the following commands:

1) chmod +x FileName
2) ./FileName
